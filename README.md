# Memoization

These JavaScript files provide educational content for the concept of [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) exemplified by the computation of binomial coefficients.

-   `01-basic.js`: normal recursive computation of binomial coefficients
-   `02-howMany.js`: evaluation how many times the function is called for each argument
-   `03-cache.js`: uses a cache to fasten the computation
-   `04-memoize.js`: generalizes this idea to a memoize decorator function
-   `05-application.js`: applies the memoize decorator function to the binomial coefficients
-   `06-performance.js`: shows how much memoization boosts performance
